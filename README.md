# International-Chat-Bot-in-Telegram

This is my bot for translating and destroying the language barrier!

My concept was that I'm not always able to understand foreign speech (I have a friend from Argentina, but I don't speak Spanish). 
So, I decided that I needed to build a bot for chatting with instant translation of messages into my language. 
Was it successful? Yes, I made it! However, Telegram embedded this function...

https://t.me/TranslateKrotBot - used to be here, nowadays I stopped it (I dont have a hosting)

This project is my own and I kindly request that you do not copy it or list me as a co-author with a link to my GitHub for support. 

The project was built using Python version 3.10.

Read license!

## Required Libraries

The following libraries are required to run the project:

- `telebot` to be connected with Telegram 
- `googletrans` really bad translation, but its free 
- `sqlite3` I have a database of the users here.
- `deepl` awesome translator that uses AI, but tokens are limited >:
- `itertools` iterators for kids
